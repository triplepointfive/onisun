### Damage and armor types

Generally, every single damage made to a creature has a type. Each damage type behaves differently with different armor types. E.g. melee attack does lower damage on heavy armor and higher on medium armor.

Below is a table of ratios for damages and armor types:

|        | Light | Medium | Heavy | Solid | Unarmored |
| ------ | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- | --------- |
| Melee  | 1     | 2/3    | 1     | 4/3   | 1         |
| Pierce | 1/2   | 4/3    | 1     | 3     | 3/4       |
| Blunt  | 1     | 2      | 1     | 1/2   | 1/2       |
| Magic  | 5/4   | 3/4    | 1/2   | 3     | 1         |
| Pure   | 0     | 0      | 0     | 0     | 0         |

Also, the damage might have a subtype, which is used to be able to block the damage entirely. Like, frost attack has type Magic, and if a victim has magic block equipment, the damage will be reduced. But if the victim has ice resistance, the damage will be blocked fully, no matter what kind of armor the victim wears.

### Resistances

All creatures can have resistances to different damage types. Some of them are built in, but some may be acquired with items or other tricks. This is a list of all damage related resistances:

| Name           | Blocks                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Anemia         | Bleeding                     |
| Antidote       | Poison                       |
| Insulator      | Electricity                  |
| Intangible     | Melee, pierce, blunt attacks |
| Magic Immunity | Magic attacks                |
